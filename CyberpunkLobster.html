        <p class="text-center">This game was my first project of CMU's Entertainment Technology Center master's program. I was designated lead programmer on the team of 5, and having some 
        producer experience, I volunteered for that as well. Since we only had two weeks to develop this, we held daily standups to talk about what we had done the day before and what we were planning on doing that day. Our team worked very well together, and everyone felt comfortable asking for help. Ultimately, we had to cut down on the scope of our project due to time constraints, but the final product is still representative of a cross-section of what we originally imagined - we just didn't have any more time for level design. Moving forward, that was a big thing I took with me. It doesn't matter if the mechanics work if there is no experience in the end.</p>
