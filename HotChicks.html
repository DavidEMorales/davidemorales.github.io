        <p class="text-center">This game was specifically designed for the CMU ETC's semester end festival, so we knew we wanted to implement multiplayer from the very beginning. We used Photon Unity Networking to enable players to connect to a lobby and sync player attributes across game instances throughout the country. This was my first venture into Unity multiplayer, and it was very difficult, but it taught me a lot about making sure all players are synced and seeing the same thing. We had to deal with a lot of message buffering due to sending too many player updates per frame. We had to balance jittery visuals and realtime visuals. A lot of effort was put into optimizing both of these to allow a player a smooth and cohesive experience.</p>
