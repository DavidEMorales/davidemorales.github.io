As one person shouts angrily, their head produced outward-facing spikes whose size are dependent on how loudly the shouting is. The individual being yelled at experiences the same, but with the spikes facing inward.</td>

Nevertheless, all objects collide with each other in both eyes despite the user not seeing them.</td>

The player would be able to interact using their hands using a LeapMotion, with their body being reflected across from them in the mirror. Throughout the experience, we would mutate and corrupt both the mirror world and the real world to the point where the mirror was no longer recognizable as a mirror and the guests's nightmare had come true.</td>
