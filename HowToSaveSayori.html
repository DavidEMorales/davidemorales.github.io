        <p class="text-center">This game was a little side project of mine based around the game Doki Doki Literature Club (DDLC). (Use of these assets and characters are explicitly allowed according to the <a href="http://teamsalvato.com/ip-guidelines/">IP guidelines</a>.) I had only ever made one 2D game in unity before (X-tend), but in actuality that game was made in 3D with the camera in a side view. This game was my first attempt at a real 2D game using sprites and sprite sheet animations.</p>

        <p class="text-center">I'm satisfied with how the ultimate product turned out. The fact that the game gets exponentially more difficult is intentional - it illustrates the struggle Sayori goes through during her depression - but the game does have a win state. The game means a lot to me, and I'm happy to have created this. Sometimes, it's not about who the artist is, but rather that the art exists for someone to admire in the first place.</p>
